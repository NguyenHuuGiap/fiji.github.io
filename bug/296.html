<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I don't think that libCg.so has anything to do with the Fiji Debian packages - at least not explicitly.  In order to help, however, I'll need much more information in this bug report.  Could you possibly add as a comment:

- The error message that you get when just running &quot;fiji&quot; from the command line.
- Any errors you got when installing the packages, including the command that you used to install them.

?

many thanks,

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >my apologies - I should have included several clarifications and details, but I thought I had limited space to describe the bug ... anyway:

1. the binary package that I used is NOT .deb anymore, but converted to .rpm using &quot;alien -rk --scripts&quot; (it was converted without errors, including its scripts!); in the evening I will give the initial.deb package a try on a debian-based (LMDE) machine at home and post the results, but I don't think that conversion caused the problem I described;

2. in my particular case, when I ran into the &quot;libCg.so(VERSION)&quot; dependency error while installing (system-wide), I over-rode it with --no-deps (RPM) option, since I was sure libCg was installed; as a result, now I have that &quot;libCg.so(VERSION)&quot; (only) broken dependency reported by my GUI package manager (YaST2), so that's a problem I have to fix somehow; and I was hoping that that could be corrected in the install scripts

3. the output of running &quot;fiji&quot; in command prompt was:

Found that JAVA_HOME was: '/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/'
Could not launch system-wide Java (No such file or directory)

so it is not libCg.so fault after all that fiji does not run; maybe I should close that particular bug report?

I'll close it shortly, but hopefully you can fix that problem by running:

    unset JAVA_HOME

... before running fiji from the terminal.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Just to conclude - I installed Fiji system-wide on a Debian-based (LMDE) machine tonight using the package from the provided APT repository and there was no problem at all; the libCg.so dependency obviously is problematic only in my particular case (installing from a deb-to-rpm converted package); since I need a RPM-based system-wide Fiji install, I have to figure out a different approach (but that's more suitable for the forums, not here); once again, sorry for my initial incomplete post and for wasting your time on that issue!</pre>
