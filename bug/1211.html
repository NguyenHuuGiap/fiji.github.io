<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hello,

<span class="quote">&gt;Where does FIJI pull the java informatino and how do I get it to recognize the new Java version.</span >

There is some (unfortunately complex) logic when Fiji starts up where it looks in various locations for Javas. 

The default behavior is to try to use the latest Java. There is a known issue on Macs where Java 8 isn't being chosen over Java 7. We actually have a pending fix for this right now.

If you would like to test it, download this experimental version of the launcher:

<a href="http://hinerm.imagej.net/ImageJ-macosx">http://hinerm.imagej.net/ImageJ-macosx</a>

and use it to replace the existing version in your Fiji.app/Conents/MacOS/ directory. If you do try this new launcher, it would be great to know if it works for you.

As an additional workaround you can see the FAQ for instructions on launching with different Java versions:

<a href="http://imagej.net/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_launch_ImageJ_with_a_different_version_of_Java.3F">http://imagej.net/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_launch_ImageJ_with_a_different_version_of_Java.3F</a>

If you're interested in more technical details, let me know.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I downloaded the experimental launcher and replaced the file indicated in your response. This however resulted in FIJI no longer being able to open. 

I think I figured something else out based on your suggestion of forcing FIJI to select the version of Java. When I went to Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines, I only see jdk1.7.0_51.jdk. The Java in system preferences that states 1.8.0_66 is not in the Library/Java folder. It is in the Library/INternet Plug-Ins/ and is a JavaAppletPluggin.plugin.

Oh, I'm very sorry. I just tested on a co-worker's computer and it looks like that file is downloaded without execution permissions - despite being set on the server.

After replacing the file, you can fix these permissions by opening up a Terminal and running:

  chmod a+x /path/to/Fiji.app/Conents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx

If you'd like, you can read more about chmod here: <a href="http://ss64.com/osx/chmod.html">http://ss64.com/osx/chmod.html</a>. Essentially you're just telling the computer that &quot;yes, this file has permission to be executed.&quot;

<span class="quote">&gt;It is in the Library/INternet Plug-Ins/ and is a JavaAppletPluggin.plugin</span >

Fiji is supposed to look for Java in that location. The problem comes from false negatives in Fiji's detection of Java, due to changes in file structure between Java 1.6 and 1.7+. That's precisely what is fixed in the experimental ImageJ-macosx file I had you download, so I'm hoping it will still work for you if you chmod the file.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Ok. I did a little bit of work on this. I had to download and install the latest JDK for java. That step is not so apparent. So it does not look like JDK auto updates itself and it seems as though FIJI and ImageJ depend on the latest JDK. Once I installed the latest JDK and pointed FIJI to this, FIJI responds as expected. 

So I have a few followups on this. 

1. Why does FIJI work on JDK and can FIJI alert a user as to the need to update the JDK?

2. Why does FIJI not point itself to the latest installation of JDK? I still needed to use the command line and now create an automator app to point to it. 

This seems to be a lot of work for an application to work. Is this kind of bug being worked on to make it easier for the user?

I have Windows machine and it seems unaffected by this.

Thanks

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >All is good now. I used the experimental version of the launcher with the permission change. It now loads the correct version of JDK and FIJI is working smoothly. So I guess that part is worked out.

I am still wondering about the JDK updates and how to automate that or to have FIJI alert a user to it being out of date. 

Thanks

That's great to hear. Thank you very much for testing and following up so quickly!

<span class="quote">&gt;Is this kind of bug being worked on to make it easier for the user?</span >

Definitely. This is, in general, part of our work to migrate to Java 8 (<a href="http://imagej.net/2015-12-22_-_The_road_to_Java_8">http://imagej.net/2015-12-22_-_The_road_to_Java_8</a>).

Java has an unfortunate history on the Mac, with Apple building its own version of Java and then stopping after Java 6. As a result, Fiji currently carries a lot of Apple Java 6-specific baggage - which is now causing problems with Java 7 and 8.

Our long term goal is to move to an industry standard way of interacting with Java (it looks as though JavaFX is becoming that standard) that will make transitions between Java versions easier.

In the short term, we are very close to having Fiji downloads with a bundled Java 8. Having you test the experimental launcher and confirm that it works is a big step in that direction.

Moving to a JavaFX launcher could potentially help with this. There are some concerns with allowing arbitrary Java updates (e.g. preserving scientific reproducibility, plugins outright breaking with newer Java versions). We had specific experience with this recently with the 3D viewer (<a href="http://forum.imagej.net/t/java-3d-progress-and-next-steps/135">http://forum.imagej.net/t/java-3d-progress-and-next-steps/135</a>) so part of our future plans include making it easier for ImageJ plugins to associate with a given Java version.

Anyway, the bottom line is that we agree that Java versioning needs to be more robust. If you'd like to share more observations or suggestions, it'd be great to continue the discussion on forum.imagej.net.

Thanks again for the help and feedback.</pre>
