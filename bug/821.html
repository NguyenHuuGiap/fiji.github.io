<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I've been look at
ImageJ Macro Language Programmer's Reference Guide ...
and trying to get my macro to come up installed in the Fiji buttons when Fiji starts. The macro is trivial, just for testing

macro &quot;Postage Action Tool - R0063R0663R0c63Ra063Ra663Rac63&quot; {
print(&quot;Tile&quot;);
}

I can put the macro into Fiji.app/macros/toolsets and then I can click on the &gt;&gt; button and choose them to appear on the buttons. The trouble is when I exit Fiji and then return, they are no longer on the buttons.

The next thing to try is to put the macro as part of StartupMacros.ijm in Fiji.App/AutoRun. That gets it to run once and print out &quot;Tile&quot;, but doesn't get it to appear on the buttons.

I also tried to add it to StartupMacros.fiji.ijm in Fiji.app/macros but that also gets me nothing.

So, either I still don't understand the documentation, or there is a bug.

Suggestions? Thanks,
Ilan</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Thanks Wayne. What you suggested worked, so I guess I didn't tell the whole story - not that I knew I wasn't telling the whole story.
First, I don't want all the startup tools. I want it simpler, with just 2 additional tools which I need. Never mind, here is what I didn't tell you.

From your documentation I found a Window-Level tool which changes the window-level by dragging the mouse. This is a class file, not a macro.
So, what I did was remove custom tools and add the Window-level tool.

I was delighted to see that it remembered the tool. I had my macro tool in Fiji.App/macros/toolsets. The same macro will do nicely for testing.
Now it nicely agrees to add the macro tool, together with the window-level class tool. But there is your catch-22. There seems to be no way that I can get it to bring up my macro tool when Fiji starts.
I tried putting it into Fiji.app/macros/AutoRun/StartupMacros.ijm where it would execute upon start up but not get put onto the tool bar.

Maybe it doesn't like the mix of class files with macro files?

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Using ImageJ, I can get both the macro tool and Window Level Tool plugin tool to be installed at startup by saving them in Image/plugins/tools, running Help&gt;Refresh Menus and selecting them from the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; menu.

I got the Window Level Tool (Window_Level_Tool.class) from

   <a href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/window-level-tool/index.html">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/window-level-tool/index.html</a>

and the macro tool is a file named Postage_Action_Tool.ijm containing


  macro &quot;Postage Action Tool - R0063R0663R0c63Ra063Ra663Rac63&quot; {
     print(&quot;Tile&quot;);
  }

Fiji hangs when I select &quot;Postage_Action_Tool&quot; from the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; menu but I was able to work around this problem by adding the &quot;Postage Action Tool&quot; to Fiji.app/macros/StartupMacros.fiji.ijm.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi Wayne,
I tried your suggestions and I get different results.
First of all Fiji didn't hang when I added Postage Action Tool from the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; menu. That would be very bad if for any reason Fiji hangs, and would need to be investigated as &quot;why?&quot;.
On the other hand I gained nothing by adding it to Fiji.app/macros/StartupMacros.fiji.ijm. Adding it there had an effect only if I requested Restore Startup Tools, which I clearly didn't want to do.
I see a check in the menu item Postage Action Tool but the entry gets wiped from the menu bar each time I restart Fiji. On the other hand Window-Level nicely remains available on each Fiji restart - and it doesn't have that check before the menu entry. (I can certainly do without the check mark as it contributes nothing if the entry is there when Fiji starts. Clicking it again doesn't make the entry go away, which is what I might expect. In fact the only way to remove things is click on Remove Custom Tools. Still all of that is an aside.)

I still need a way to have the tool remain on the bar when Fiji starts. The people at Beth Israel have zero tolerance for extra clicks.

Thanks,
Ilan</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi Wayne,
I'm not sure how you count 7 tools. What I would like to install is the Window-Level tool together the Postage Action Tool. The Window-Level which is a plugin tool stays on the buttons on start up. The Postage Action which is a macro doesn't appear on the buttons on start up.
My guess, and correct me if I am wrong, is the difference depends if it is a java class or a macro text. If you push me to the wall, I suppose I could convert the macro to a Java program. Seems like a waste, but if the macro won't stick around at start up, what other choice do I have?
Could I write some sort of macro to install the Postage Action at startup? There must be some way around this problem. The people at Beth Israel are starting Fiji all the time and each time to reinstall it is just totally unacceptable.

Maybe the Fiji.app/macros/StartupMacros.fiji.ijm can start some other file as well? Somehow I feel uncomfortable changing a &quot;system file&quot;. I think it is this file which determines which macros are on the custom macros. To be barbaric I could erase the file and replace it with my own creation, but that is really barbaric. I don't know how to solve the problem.

Thanks,
Ilan</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >A maximum of seven custom tools can be installed on startup.

In ImageJ, I can install the Window-Level tool and the Postage Action Tool this way:

  1. Select &quot;Remove Custom Tools&quot; from the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; menu.
  2. Select &quot;Window Level Tool&quot; from the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; menu.
  3. Select &quot;Postage Action Tool&quot; from the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; menu.

I now have two custom tools, and no other custom tools. When I restart ImageJ, these two custom tools are installed in the toolbar.

This assumes you have these two files in the ImageJ/plugins/Tools menu:

  Window_Level_Tool.class
  Postage_Action_Tool.ijm

In Fiji, step 3 does not work. Fiji runs the Postage Action Tool (&quot;Tile&quot; is displayed in the Log window) instead of installing it.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi Wayne,
Ignore the stupid print to the log window. That is something I do until I can get it stable. It just lets me know that something is happening.

Something is really screwed up with the Fiji. I don't get any crash, all is clean for me. When I install Postage Action Tool, it gets installed and doesn't print anything. Only when I click on it do I get the stupid print into the log window. However the print shows me that it is doing what I expect, which is good.

I am using a Linux 32 bit machine here. You are using something with 64 bits. The fact that the 2 act differently is definitely not good.

I've got Window_Level_Tool.class in Fiji.app/plugins/Tools and
Postage Action Tool in Fiji.app/macros/toolsets,
i.e. the class in the plugins folder and the macro in the macros folder.

I tried moving the macro to plugins/Tools, but then it no longer appears on the list of available objects to install, so I obviously can't install it. It must be in the macros folder. I'll send you a screen shot of what I see when it is in the macros folder. There it works, and works properly. The only problem is the bloody thing won't stay there when I restart Fiji.

We have a much deeper problem that my 32 bit Linux operates one way and your 64 bit thing works another way. That needs to be looked into very soon.

I'll prepare my screen shot. All is good EXCEPT Postage Action Tool doesn't come back upon start up. Nothing crashes or does any other nasty things.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi Wayne,
To me it makes no sense that a macro should be in the plugins menu. The only thing which makes sense is that a macro is in the macro menu.
I put &quot;makes sense&quot; aside and tried it. I moved Postage Action from Fiji.app/macros/toolsets to Fiji.app/plugins/Tools. Does it now appear under Plugins-&gt;Tools? The answer is &quot;no&quot;, not on Linux at least. The one and only way I can get it to appear for installation is to put it in the sensible location of Fiji.app/macros/toolsets. Look at my <span class=""><a href="../attach/170/startup1.png" name="attach_170" title="ignore the fact that I changed the name. It is Postage something....">attachment 170</a></span> and you can see what I see when it is in the logic place. Inside plugins there is no way I can install it no matter what I do.

Since for me, I can't duplicate it appearing in the plugins menu, I can't duplicate the bug. It also doesn't make sense to me that a macro is in the plugins menu.
What is even worse is that Linux, and Mac as well which I just checked this morning, are both acting differently from what you have. In both Linux and Mac I can install Postage Action when it is in macros/toolsets, but in neither case does it stay there.
Without staying there, it is totally useless.
I love these Fiji buttons, which I only recently discovered and I am working on improving WL and I may have some requests for you. Still the macro button has to work as well, otherwise the whole idea is useless.
Thanks for all your help,
Ilan</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi Wayne,
The Mac which I checked belongs to Jerry Kolodny. I couldn't afford to take a chance at screwing up his machine. He uses it daily to look at several Pet-Cts.
I figured I could live a bit more dangerously with one of the hospital computers. I just went into Beth Israel and checked a Windows7, 64 bit machine. It works exactly the same as my Linux and Jerry's Mac, i.e. Postage Action is not visible and/or installable from inside the plugins/Tools menu. It is visible and installable from inside macros/toolsets, but it doesn't stay there.
Thanks,
Ilan</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi Wayne,
Assuming these custom tools will fly, I would like to ask you a favor. I am enhancing the WL plugin tool so that it will have a menu to choose either &quot;Auto&quot; or &quot;Reset&quot;. With the WL control the user can easily loose control where his gray scale is, and I want to add functions parallel to the B&amp;C Auto and Reset buttons.

I saw that you have a right click to change the meaning of Rectangle to rounded rectangle and I thought that was a great idea. I thought I could solve the problem of the user loosing control with the WL by adding a popup menu with Auto and Reset.

I had to make a couple of additions to get the popup menu to fly. For built in functions I saw how you were doing it, so I wanted to extend the idea to external functions. The Toolbar takes care of internal functions, so external functions need to take care of themselves. You have something built in for options on macro functions, so I wanted to extend that to plugins as well. The code addition is

    if (isMacroTool(current) &amp;&amp; isRightClick) {
	String name = names[current].endsWith(&quot; &quot;)?names[current]:names[current]+&quot; &quot;;
	tools[current].runMacroTool(name+&quot;Options&quot;);
	}
	if (isPlugInTool(current) &amp;&amp; isRightClick) {
		tools[current].showPopupMenu(e, this);
	}

in the MousePressed routine in Toolbar.java. It comes after the existing isMacroTool and isRightClick. I need to check isPlugInTool and isRightClick

Likewise I need to enter a template
	public void showPopupMenu(MouseEvent e, Toolbar par) {}
in PlugInTool.java

If I can ask these additions, we will be ready to fly once you find what is bothering the macro from being remembered. I can say that I don't know what it is. I also don't understand the magic of how it picks up things inside Fiji.app/plugins/Tools, but it somehow works.
In any case I really like these buttons and I want to use them.
Thanks,
Ilan</pre>

Plugins can be written in many different languages.

Change the name of the file in Fiji.app/plugins/Tools to

    Postage_Action_Tool.ijm

and it should appear in both the Plugins&gt;Tools menu and in the toolbar's &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; menu. ImageJ installs macro files with names ending in &quot;Tool.ijm&quot; in the toolbar. The contents of the file should be:

  macro &quot;Postage Action Tool - R0063R0663R0c63Ra063Ra663Rac63&quot; {
     print(&quot;Tile&quot;);
  }


<span class="quote">&gt; The one and only way I can get it to appear for

Toolsets are sets of tools, not a single tool.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi Wayne,
Thanks for the pointing out of the importance of the underscore character. I knew about this for plugins but not for macros.
I changed the name of the macro exactly as you suggested and now I do see it in the list of objects which can be installed to the tool bar.
Installing Window_Level works properly as expected but trying to install Postage_Action_Tool.ijm causes a freeze.
Just for an experiment I copied the file to Fiji.app/macros/toolsets. Now I had a choice of 2 places from which to install it. From the macros/toolsets it would install and operate correctly (print into a log window). It won't remember it after restart. From plugins/Tools it just freezes and I have to go to System Monitor to kill the process.
I ran it from a terminal
ilan&#64;ilan-main:~/Fiji.app$ ./ImageJ-linux32
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.bushe.swing.event.EventService).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
log4j:WARN See <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig">http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig</a> for more info.
[ERROR] Skipping unsupported option -port7

All of the above is at startup and there are no new messages when it freezes.
Thanks,
Ilan</pre>

Can you use a dialog box with a popup menu? Plugin tools can display an options dialog box when the user double clicks on the tool icon. There is an example at
 
   <a href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/arrow-tool/index.html">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/arrow-tool/index.html</a>

Right clicking is used to switch between tools (e.g., from rectangle tool to/from rounded rectangle too), which is currently not possible with plugin tools.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi Wayne,
Since discovering these plugin tools I really want to use them. They are simply great. In fact I added 2 very small bits of code which extend the idea of the right click to external tools. I have it working on my machine and it is very nice.
I don't want to mix the idea of options (double click) with a popup menu (right click). Both are good and both are necessary. What I added changes nothing in the way the code acts. It simply checks for an additional possibility.

I changed Toolbar.jar to
    if (isMacroTool(current) &amp;&amp; isRightClick) {
	String name = names[current].endsWith(&quot; &quot;)?names[current]:names[current]+&quot; &quot;;
	tools[current].runMacroTool(name+&quot;Options&quot;);
	}
	if (isPlugInTool(current) &amp;&amp; isRightClick) {
		tools[current].showPopupMenu(e, this);
	}

adding the isPlugInTool and isRightClick after the equivalent check for isMacroTool and isRightClick

Likewise I added to the template
	public void showPopupMenu(MouseEvent e, Toolbar par) {}
in PlugInTool.java.

With these 2 additions the popup menu on external plugin tools works. I have 2 popup menu items on my version of Window-Level called Auto and Reset. I haven't yet filled in the code to do the required things, but I don't foresee any problems with it. The question is: will you accept the changes? If so, I don't know if it is easier if I try to make them or you make them.

The difference with the internal tools is that Toolbar.java takes care of the popup menus for internal tools, whereas external tools need to take care of themselves. That is the reason for showPopupMenu(MouseEvent e, Toolbar par).

Let me know what you think.
Thanks,
Ilan</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi Wayne,
I have yet to fill out the code portion of autoItemActionPerformed and resetItemActionPerformed. Originally I wrote to James Norman asking him to expand the code. To date I haven't received any answer so perhaps he is no longer supporting the code. Since I needed it, I decided to expand his code myself.
I have it to the point that it works inside my ImageJ test bed. I use NetBeans to develop code and use ImageJ within NetBeans. In the end everything goes over to Fiji.
Within ImageJ Window_Level_Tool.java works and there is a popup menu with the 2 items from Brightness &amp; Contrast which I need. When I press on the menu entry it reaches the action performed stubs, and now I just need to fill them out with real code.
Clearly for it to work in Fiji, I need the additions in the core code.
Thanks,
Ilan</pre>
