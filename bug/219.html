<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Sorry I thought it was an error, but it seems to be doing something.. 
It now says Calculating Gaussian.. 
So probably Gaussian is being done.
However the status bar is not moving and it doesn't show intermediate results or so as was in the tutorial video.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Sorry about spurios mails that I have created.
It seems 'Hessian-based analysis' takes quite much time. 
When I first opened it I wasn't quite sure what the error 'image stack is empty' meant in the context of 'hessian-based analysis'. Especially since already an image was loaded which I had been tracing. (I had searched for this phrase in the error search database, but didn't find anything).
The last error seemed to arise when I cancled the process of 'hessain-based analysis' and I might have pressed somewhere on the actual image stack. 

So far, I haven't got Hessian-based analysis working, I wonder if it just takes quite much time (I have waited for about 1/2 hour, didn't finish), or it crashed due to big file size.. 
It would be nice to know what is actually happening, and if there is anything I should be keeping in mind when I use that.

Thanks again for developing this software. It is very nice to use, and also for the quick help. 
Next time I create a report, I would try to be more succint and follow the instructions that you suggested.

<span class="quote">&gt; Please take the time to make a coherent bug report where you say _exactly_ how

Indeed - in addition to a recipe for reproducing the problem, as Johannes asks
for, could you also let me know:

 - Does this problem happen every time now, or was it a one-off?

 - Is this a 2D image or 3D image stack?

 - What are the dimensions of the image you are tracing?

 - I see that you've marked your platform as Mac OS - could you let me know
which version of Mac OS you are using?

 - Did you have any other images or windows opened in ImageJ when you started
tracing your image?

I'm afraid I haven't managed to reproduce this bug yet, but with some of the
above details, perhaps we can.

When there's a (hopefully rare) error like this some buttons may be left
disabled, I'm afraid.  I will improve this in a future version.

mark

[..]

It may take a very long time depending on the image size (as I mentioned in the previous comment), the value of sigma that you are choosing and (of course) the specification of the computer you're using.  So if you can supply those details maybe we can rule that out or investigate further.

Another thing to check is to run the system monitor - if the CPU is at 100% then that's a strong indication that it's just taking a long time.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >- Does this problem happen every time now, or was it a one-off?
I am using the same image, and it seems to happen each time. 

 - Is this a 2D image or 3D image stack?
It was a 3D image stack
size was 116 MB.

 - What are the dimensions of the image you are tracing?
3D

 - I see that you've marked your platform as Mac OS - could you let me know
which version of Mac OS you are using?

Version 10.5.8

 - Did you have any other images or windows opened in ImageJ when you started
tracing your image?


No only one image was open. 

I'm afraid I haven't managed to reproduce this bug yet, but with some of the
above details, perhaps we can.

the screen capture of the neurite tracer window

Hi 
The CPU usage is only about 10 - 15 % and the one used by fiji is only .1 % .

For the value of sigma, I had used the default value.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Since I still can't see how this is happening with any of the test images I've tried, would you be prepared to upload this file so that I can try to reproduce the problem with the same file that you're using?  (It can be any image file that causes this problem for you in Simple Neurite Tracer.)

Of course, I will only use this image to try to fix the problem.  If you would be happy with that, then you can use the &quot;Help &gt; Upload Sample Image&quot; menu option, which will upload the file so that myself and the other Fiji developers can look at it.

Yihwa,

Thank you for uploading that.  However, I don't have any problem turning on Hessian-based analysis for that image.  Could you possible describe exactly what you do, with that precise image, from starting Fiji until you get the exception?  For example, that should include how you open the file (which exact menu option), which options you select at each stage, and so on.

I hope this isn't too much trouble to go to, but this is one of those cases where it seems that a really detailed bug report will be necessary.

many thanks,

A-ha!  I think the problem is that you're opening the image as a virtual stack.  Try opening it just normally (e.g. with File &gt; Open ...) and see if that works better.  In any case, I'll add a helpful error if people try to use a virtual stack for something that's not supported.

mark</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Yes Indeed!!!
It works now! :) 
Thanks!

Uhm I didn't know it was different, loading the file via 'open' option and the import 'open virtual stack'. 
What are the differences? 

With regards to the 'Hessian based analysis' itself, I don't see so much difference in the quality of the image itself before and after. 
What should I be expecting to see?

Best wishes

I have released a change that means that this option should work even if you do open the stack as a virtual stack.  If you go to &quot;Help &gt; Update Fiji&quot; you should be offered the uption to update jars/VIB-lib.jar - this should fix the problem.

In answer to your question, the results of the filtering aren't shown in the image, but will affect the search between points and paths found.  (If you turn it on and off you should see a difference in the character of the search progress shown on the image in cyan.)

If you want to see the results on your image, you can run the &quot;Plugins &gt; Analyze &gt; Tubeness&quot;.  For a small region and a limited number of different values of sigma, the &quot;Pick Sigma Visually&quot; option will show you a preview of the &quot;tubeness&quot; filtering on the small region you select.

I hope that's of some help.

Hi I have tried &quot;Plugins &gt; Analyze &gt; Tubeness&quot; option, however I got the error that it is out of memory. 
I tried to increase the memory but it was already set to 2.7 GB (which was more than the 2GB I had). 
Does this function require a lot of memory? ?
