<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hi,

In &quot;ImageJ Macro&quot; language mode of the Script editor, I noticed a strange behavior when I try to put something delimited by double quotation mark. If you put the left double quotation in &quot;ImageJ Macro&quot; language mode, the cursor disappears and you cannot see what you type in. If you put the right hand quotation mark after you type in for a while -despite they cannot be seen, though- the string appears in reverse order (I mean &quot;reverse order&quot; appears as &quot;redro esrever&quot;. Strange, isn't it :-)) ). But, if you put the left hand and right hand double quotation marks together in advance, and then you start to type in between them, everything appears and behaves normal.

This problem sometimes make the script editor crashed. I have tested the above scenario using remaining language modes, but the only mode with this problem seems to be the &quot;ImageJ Macro&quot; language option.

Thank you..

<span class="quote">&gt; I guess you are talking about “UTF-8 quoting”. This is indeed not what the

&gt; </span >

Please use the latest non-developer version of Fiji. Follow these steps

1) Starts Fiji 2) File &gt; New &gt; Script 3) Language &gt; ImageJ Macro -in the script editor window- 4) Put the left double quotation mark &quot; and type something -at this point I could not see what I was typing in- 5) Put the closing quotation mark at the end -at this point all characters that I typed in appeared in reverse order-

Please take a look at the screenshot image of the attachment id=28 in <a href="#c3">Comment #3</a>

So, I you can understand from this brief explanation, I did not change any character code settings -ascii, utf-8 etc-. I noticed this bug while I was using the Fiji &quot;as is&quot;.

Thank you.

So, if I understand correctly, you are implying that I must have dreamed of such a bug? I don't think so. Please have a look at the comments #3 and #4. By the way, I did not edited any of the macros outside the Fiji. My keyboard layout is Turkish Q, and my locale is English US. Besides, even if this incident was related to my keyboard layout or locale, it is still a bug I think.

Thank you.

<pre class="bz_comment_text" ><span class="quote">&gt; So, if I understand correctly, you are implying that I must have dreamed of
&gt; such a bug? </span >

No, I did not imply anything, so please do not use sarcastic comments here, as they do not help me (or anybody else) to help you.
I invite you to read my message again, you will find that I said that it works fine here and suggested 2 reasons why the problem you reported might be happening.

Now you have clarified about using Fiji &quot;as is&quot;. Did you try updating it? If not, I suggest to do as there have been lots of bug fixes since the date of the installation packages.

Please go to: Help&gt;Update Fiji and report back if this still happens in the updated system.

I an not sure what is the screenshot attempting to show us (is the direction of writing is reversed?).
If I type any string in &quot;  &quot; I see something similar to what the screenshot shows but left to right, and I can carry on typing.

When you type the document is written from right to left? 
What happens when you open a macro file with quotation marks? Can you edit it?
What happens when you revert the keyboard layout to English?

Something else, what do you mean &quot;left double quotation mark&quot;.
According to this page there is 1 in the Turkish Q, but 2 in the Turkish F keyboard:
<a href="http://www.corened.nl/support/keyboard_layout_illustrations.htm">http://www.corened.nl/support/keyboard_layout_illustrations.htm</a>

I wonder if there is something wrong in the keyboard setting or the mapping that is sending out the UTF-8 quoting codes.

But before that I would try updating Fiji anyway.

Hi,

I did not try to be sarcastic and no offense was intended at all. (Besides, I
have read your message at least three times before replying it). Whatever,
sorry about that. Of course I have updated Fiji, before reported this issue.

The screenshot shows the final result of the steps I followed, which were
summarized in my previous message. I had intended to type &quot;This is a genuine
bug&quot;, but the resulting strings appears as &quot;gub eniuneg a si sihT&quot;. By the way,
Turkish latin alphabet is written from left to right, not from right to left.
If I type in a double quotation mark &quot;&quot; and then click in between them, and
then type in something in between them, everything goes normal and the
resulting text is also seen in correct left to right order. The problem only
exists, if you put a &quot; sign, and then type something -as someone usually do-
they cannot be seen on the screen until you put the closing &quot; sign at the end.
As soon as you put the closing &quot; sign, the text you just typed in appears on
the screen, but in a reverse order. I hope, this time I was able to manage to
explain the problem correctly.

And finally, please read the <a href="#c9">comment #9</a>.

Thank you..

Yildirim
