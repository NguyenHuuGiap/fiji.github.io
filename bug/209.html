<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Hello,

I have just downloaded the latest version of fiji to give it a try of the script editor. Everything went OK except the unusually long time (a few minutes) to get the script editor window after select the menu item File &gt; New &gt; Script. I realized that this time lag is only an issue after starting the first time of Fiji. Without restarting Fiji, I was able to close and then restart script editor window several times. But, having restarted Fiji, I have experienced the same unexpectedly long waiting time for getting script editor up and running.

Unfortunately, I am not a programer. So, I do not have any idea for this. Thank you very much for your efforts on this unvaluable project. You guys rock :-))

I can't reproduce this either at the moment, but just to rule out some possible causes, could I just check whether:

 - You're using a virus checker which is set to be very cautious?

 - You're running Fiji from a network drive?

Gabriel: could you file that as a new bug, just to keep them separate?</pre>

Hi,

I have run the Fiji on my notebook without using any network drive.

I am using Avira Antivir Personal edition with default settings (I don't think it is not set very cautious as is)</pre>

Hello again,

I have tested Fiji using another notebook running Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit. It seems that the problem (very long start-up time for script editor) still there. In that case, the bug must not be related the OS architecture or JRE, I suppose.

I hope this information will be useful for developers.</pre>

Hi,

I have run the Fiji just after I had downloaded. I did not add any plug-in or jar file. Besides, I have tested the latest Fiji distribution on the PC in my office yesterday, and the problem was still there.</pre>
